_Here, brother, I've set this up. Fly as high a you can!_, said Mr. Wright to his mate as he offered him his freshly prepared flight.  

One would argue that's not how the Wright brothers built the first aeroplane. And I agree, I'm not talking about any aeroplane. This anecdote is about John Wright getting his roomate Craig started with weed.  

Hey there,  

Welcome to the **issue #30** of **Knowledgeâ€¢Day**. Hope you're doing awesome!  

You know, after publishing my [first podcast](https://cutt.ly/2gOEnZF), which was on the same topic as this newsletter's first issue. Cannabis (Hemp to be specific). It caught me in. Not the drug, the idea.   
I don't consume any of the illegal drugs but that shouldn't stop us from knowing a thing or two.  

If you're like me, and probably clueless about almost all the "cool things", this one is for you. Join along.
