_Here, brother, I've set this up. Fly as high a you can!_, said Mr. Wright to his mate as he offered him his freshly prepared flight.  

One would argue that's not how the Wright brothers built the first aeroplane. And I agree, I'm not talking about any aeroplane. This anecdote is about John Wright getting his roomate Craig started with weed.  

Hey there,  

Welcome to the **issue #30** of **Knowledge•Day**. Hope you're doing awesome!  

You know, after publishing my [first podcast](https://cutt.ly/2gOEnZF), which was on the same topic as this newsletter's first issue. Cannabis (Hemp to be specific). It caught me in. Not the drug, the idea.   
I don't consume any of the illegal drugs but that shouldn't stop us from knowing a thing or two.  

If you're like me, and probably clueless about almost all the "cool things", this one is for you. Join along.

# Top illegal psychedelics consumed globaly
(To the FBI agent reading this article: this isn't a dealership reference. You will not get any info about anyone breaking teh law here)   

Alright, now that the cops are gone. You can feel free to share your experiences and recommendations in the comments 😉   

Let's go through what ever the public internet had for me:  

## Marijuana
'Course I am going to start with this. My [first issue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/KnowledgeDay/issues/good-guy-cannabis-knowledge-day-249739) was about cannabis - hemp which is legal globally <sub><sup>(afaik)</sup></sub>!   

Marijuana, well, not so much.    
You know it's famous, it's the highest consumed one globally out of this bunch. It's sort of addictive. But not known to be chemically addictive, but many health experts it is psychologically addictive. Which makes it totally controllable if one really wishes so.  

While this is the most benign of the list. Addiction has known to cause effects. Like irrittion when it's not around, mild restlessness, and some difficulties in sleep as well.
New Zealand studied teens who regularly consumed the drug. They were found to have **lost** and average of **8 IQ points** by mid-adulthood.  
So, kids, lower the amount until you cross mid-adulthood ;-)  

## Heroin
Heroin is like salary. Heroin users instantly get a “rush,” and after a time, cannot experience any good feelings without it.  
Herion is a semi-synthetic substance that is extracted from the opium plant <sub><sup>(mm)</sup></sub>.
