Welcome to a bonus **Knowledgeâ€¢Day** issue. Why? Today marks half year anniversay of this newsletter.  

It's been 6 months - 30 posts in, I've learned a lot, I've served a lot. This has been an awesome journey and I'd like to start this issue by thanking you. Doesn't matter if you signed up at the start or did last week, just gotta say you're awesome! and I'm glad to have you <3  

before I begin with the data, I have a request form you. Please respond *now* or after the *end of this issue* by [replying back](mailto:) on **What one thing would you prefer to change about this newsletter?**  

--------

Just like the [first quarter issue](https://knowledgeday.in/a-quarter-of-texts/) I'm going to bring up some numbers first and then I'll proceed with journey since the last update. It's no small I tell you.  

As was the last analytics status. I still do not track email opens. Means I have no clue how many of my readers open my email. All I have is sign up counts.  

- I've seen **37% new subscribers** in this quarter. Actually pretty low in real numbers, but I'm still happy.  
- I've also had to see **2** people **unsubscribe** in this quarter. That's two more than the first one. :'(  
- Responses have slowed down. **13 responses** in total for the last 12 issues. Versus 45 in the first quarter.

While it all sounds low, I'm hopeful this quarter is gonna change graph direction as I've changed some priorities for the road ahead (Next section covers that).

# The story so far

This newsletter began as an escape from my entirely tech centric lifestyle and a means to spread the unimportant information that I come across, while I lurk on the internet.

It's still almost the same. 

# The End
That's it. As said, no knowledge this week. I like talk through the experience as I progress
