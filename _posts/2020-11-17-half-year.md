Welcome to a bonus **Knowledge•Day** issue. Why? Today marks half year anniversay of this newsletter.  

This newsletter began as an escape from my entirely tech centric lifestyle and a means to spread the unimportant information that I come across, while I lurk on the internet.  
It's been 6 months - 30 posts in, I've learned a lot, I've served a lot. This has been an awesome journey and I'd like to start this issue by thanking you. Doesn't matter if you signed up at the start or did last week, just gotta say you're awesome! and I'm glad to have you <3  

before I begin with the data, I have a request form you. Please respond *now* or after the *end of this issue* by [replying back](mailto:) on **What one thing would you prefer to change about this newsletter?**  

--------

Just like the [first quarter issue](https://knowledgeday.in/a-quarter-of-texts/) I'm going to bring up some numbers first and then I'll proceed with journey since the last update. It's no small I tell you.  

As was the last analytics status. I still do not track email opens. Means I have no clue how many of my readers open my email. All I have is sign up counts.  

- I've seen **37% new subscribers** in this quarter. Actually pretty low in real numbers, but I'm still happy.  
- I've also had to see **2** people **unsubscribe** in this quarter. That's two more than the first one. :'(  
- Responses have slowed down. **13 responses** in total for the last 12 issues. Versus 45 in the first quarter.

While it all sounds low, I'm hopeful this quarter is gonna change graph direction as I've changed some priorities for the road ahead (Next section covers that).

# The story so far

> **_Quick Recap_**: KD started over on a newsletter platform [Revue](http://getrevue.co/), then I took it off after two of my issues got crumbled randomly. So I built a small email newsletter program (in C#) and started sending issues with that, with online version for each issue being posted on [telegraph](http://telegra.ph/).
Soon I felt the lack of visits, and shifted the online version to [medium](https://medium.com/), which helped me with some visitors. Emails were still being triggered through my small program, there was a lot of manual intervention involved for each issue. I had to edit the content html for each post. Lot's of extra work.  
Even though [one of my medium posts](https://medium.com/the-capital/from-bitcoin-to-mining-to-halving-all-explained-like-were-five-3ca5ba2cef8) got publication eyes and was requested to be published under their publication (that's amazing), yet I still kinda felt something lacking and wanted control over the online view too. So I set up a Jekyll based blog using [this](http://artemsheludko.com/flexible-jekyll/) theme by [Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko).  

That was a lot of transitions in the first quarter. I'm not sure if it was called for. I'm sure just switching the newsletter platform was gonna fix the issues I was faing with Revue. But being a programmer, I wanted to do it myself. Because why not, and I have had huge learnings running this newsletter. Both in tech and non-tech.  
Let's continue...

First the website. For almost 5 months I was capturing subscribers' email addresses using a google form. Simple to use stuff, does its job and has no free-tier-limits type thing. Which is great. But it's not configurable and I noticed couple of people who opened the google form but never filled it. Natural course of action - have a better form.  
This would ideally be easy if I had a website deployed with a database. But you see Jekyll is backendless. So what do?  
Enter formspree, a service I found which I can integrate into any webpage or webapp and it'll take care of the user inputs. Awesome, I added that into the left bar of my website.  
There were additional changes I made, like content alignment and couple aesthetics, not biggies.  

There's still a lot that I can could optimize it for more sign ups. But that you add annoyance for my existing visitors, I don't want that. The website is on hold for now. Only content will be added as I write.  

One more thing I added for authenticity and acknowledging my dedication towards this newsletter. I purchased a domain. It's hosted on [knowledgeday.in](http://knowledgeday.in/).  
P.S. That's the only penny I've spent on the website. The hosting is free for lifetime. I just have to spend for domain renewals each year. (Ask away if you waana know how)  

Alright, that was the website. But didn't I say I had to write and edit html for each newsletter I send?  
Well, no sane man can keep doing that forever. The newsletter app was built in a hurry and was hardly modifiable by design.  
I sat another weekend with comparatively saner pland, recreated the entire thing. Again in C#, because I'm familiar with it.  
Now I write content in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), both for my website and for the newsletter. The app processes the essential conversions and presents to me a webpage which would be the email. I say a "Yes" and boom! You're reading it.  

I along with the app rewrite, I rewrote the template. Because the previous one was clumsy, and well, was integrated with the previous email app. I kinda like the newer top header, it matches with the website a little.

Everything changes everything. I have killed the **Knowledge•Day _shots_** branding (Which, if you don't know, was sent every alternate weekend). Why? It wasn't very different
