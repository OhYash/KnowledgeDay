  /r/running to tech to petting horrors to psychology behind success. This one is packed with stories.

Welcome to the fifth KD TiLT issue (and 47<sup>th</sup> Knowledge•Day issue).  

> The **_Things I Learned Today (TiLT)_** edition is all about 5 handpicks from the internet, targetting 5 different domains, because not everyone has the same interests.  

This informal talk only goes into the email version of all my posts but since today's is special I'm willing to put this up on the website too.  
I'm excited to announce that I've adopted a cat! A soft fluffy Persian cat!!  
And it's exciting because this is my first pet. My first living, breathing responsibility!  

I'd begin to talk about how every day feels, but then it'd become a personal blog instead of a Knowledge•Day issue. You still get to see the cat! and me! before we get to today's content.

### [How to Run Slower to Run Faster](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-run-slower-to-run-faster-1847752652?utm_source=knowledgeday_newsletter)

Wait...What? That doesn't look to be making any sense at all...but if it's called a life hacker it probably works.  
This is a piece of unusual cardio advice that tells you to kick back and relax, ditch the running playlist, and ignore the numbers. And also to stop visiting /r/running if you wanna run faster.  
Care to read how it works?

Na Na, this isn't about me. So far, I'm very happy with my new baby.  
But there are families, who really thought they could get that rabbit, unrealizing it's not gonna be a happy carrot-eating bun around. There are tons of free problems around it. For example, Rabbits are often seen as starter pets, but actually, they're not good with children. They have powerful legs and the little kids learn through the kick they get from these bunnies.  
Did I tell you how often do they defecate in a day? This article covers that along with other pet horrors.

### [Sieve that... email?](http://sieve.info/overview?utm_source=knowledgeday_newsletter)
_5 - 6 minutes read | sieve.info_

Draft by Tim Showadlter, Sieve is a proposed internet standard language to filter emails. Y'know, the email filter you use to separate off your Slack and maybe Jira emails from the main inbox.  
I didn't know that syntax has a name too. Did you?

### [James Webb telescope is going to be 100 times as powerful as the popular Hubble telescope](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22664709/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-december-science-hubble?utm_source=knowledgeday_newsletter)

Based on the name of a former NASA Administrator, James Webb, the upcoming telescope will be a large infrared telescope with an approx 6.5-meter gold-hued primary mirror (that's huge!).  
Planned to be deployed in space in December of this year, it'll be the premier observatory of the next decade.  
Wanna see how else can they be contrasted, and see some unforgettable, jaw-droppingly beautiful images like those of the Lagoon Nebula and the Pillars of Creation captured by the Hubble telescope in its 30-year run? This article is the one for you.

### [Is Success Luck or Hard Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I?utm_source=knowledgeday_newsletter)

[![Success paradox](https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/3LopI4YeC4I/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I?utm_source=knowledgeday_newsletter)

Recognize the channel? It's a very popular channel carrying videos about science mostly. It was also a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyQwgBAaBag) from the same youtube channel which sparked up my last KD topic - the one covering [How sailboats can sail faster than wind](https://knowledgeday.in/sailboat-wind-relation/).  
Alright, that channel aside. I'm sharing a psychology topic from the science hobbyists stage.  
Here's a question from one of the parts of the video: Does your time of birth (in a year) affect your chances of success in something? (studies/sports/crime?)
