Hey there,  

Welcome to the third KD TiLT issue (and 44<sup>th</sup> Knowledge•Day issue).  

> The **_Things I Learned Today (TiLT)_** edition is all about 5 handpicks from the internet, targetting 5 different domains, because not everyone has the same interests.  

Two billionaires (Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos) have flown to space since the last issue. 2021 marks the year for the first-ever billionaire to fly to space. Mind you, those were some really expensive trips, but even the two are quite far apart in terms of the height reached and the costs as well.  
[Richard Branson’s historic 4-minute travel into space was worth $841 million for Virgin Galactic](https://cutt.ly/uQwOyuI), and [Jeff Bezos' 11 minutes is speculated to have been costed about $5.5 Billion](https://cutt.ly/JQwOuif).  

I'd like to contrast that to this newsletter, which costs **zero** and is **ad-free**. That deserves a shoutout I guess. Let's get to the current handpicks for you

### Songwriting 101: Learn Common Song Structures
_7 - 9 minutes | Masterclass_

_verse - chorus - verse - chorus - bridge -_  
_**What are thoooose !? >.<**_  
Said I, and proceeded to search on the internet. Turns out not everyone cares enough to explore that, and if you are like me who enjoys listening to songs and was longing to know the song structures some people discuss in the comments or on reddit, this might be the time to have a quick run on that.  
Plus, as you can guess by the title, this is a song writer's guide. And you could very well read ahead on the same page to know how those structures are stacked to make a song so interesting as catchy as it is.

### How to Build a Self-Conscious Machine
_50 - 60 minutes read | Wired_

Little bit misleading title there. This one isn't a programming tutorial on how to build an AI.  
In fact, it's hardly technical at all. This is a long read on consciousness. About why things happen in the universe the way they do, why do we react to stuff in a certain way?  
Now, I'd just suggest you read a bit, maybe the intro at least to get the gist of whether you wanna read this entirely or not.  

> Thanks to Aalok, your fellow curious mind, for suggesting this article.

Lockdown + desk work/studies?  
While that combination is infamous for being lame as hell, there's another problem with it. Your body doesn't get enough physical movements. Keep it like that for more and see yourself starting to wear a cervical collar at an earlier age than your uncle did.  
Nope, not gonna let that happen.
