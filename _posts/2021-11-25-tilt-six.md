### [You’re overeating because you’re undereating.](https://twitter.com/anthonysramblin/status/1463146351626231809?t=6TtfwwvagIWrkX54XN5Suw&s=09&utm_source=knowledgeday_newsletter)
_11 tweets | Twitter thread_

Unusual twitter gem thread. **Anthony Knobbe** (a US navy vet) talks about why your body is repeatedly asking for food even though you've had it not much time ago. No, it's not because of random habitual cravings. It's related to MACRO.  
P.S. This newsletter has covered a bit about the same topic [in the past](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/KnowledgeDay/issues/it-s-not-about-nutella-knowledge-day-252574).

Remember James Webb? the upcoming large infrared telescope that was mentioned in the [previous KD TiLT issue](https://knowledgeday.in/tilt-five/?utm_source=knowledgeday_newsletter)?
