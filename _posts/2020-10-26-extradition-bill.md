And no, the newsletter is not going anywhere just yet. You'll keep getting the beloved text from me. I'll let you go anc check the Podcast out for now and I will ask about the experience in the next newsletter. For now, let's take the slice of today's knowledge. We've got a little not so fun one today ðŸ¤·

(It's actually "_One Country, Two systems_" but for of some kinky reason, the title is made to sound more familiar ðŸ˜‰)  
If you know you, know - this issue is about China and Hong Kong. Well, mainly Hong Kong and their anti-government protests. Something that striked-up last year, before corona.  
Now, before I began with the protests, I think it's fair to bring up a history for context in everything. Because the title is not related to the protests anyway.  

## Hong Kong's not so simple History
The time is 1841, and the first Opium war <sub><sup>(Mmmm)</sup></sub> is going on since 1839
