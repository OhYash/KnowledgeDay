I'll let you go anc check the Podcast out for now and I will ask about the experience in the next newsletter. For now, let's take the slice of today's knowledge. We've got a little not so fun one today ðŸ¤·  

# 2 Systems, 1 Country
(It's actually "_One Country, Two systems_" but for of some kinky reason, the title is made to sound more familiar ðŸ˜‰)  
If you know you, know - this issue is about China and Hong Kong. Well, mainly Hong Kong and their anti-government protests. Something that striked-up last year, before corona.  
Now, before I began with the protests, I think it's fair to bring up a history for context in everything. Because the title is not related to the protests anyway.  

## Hong Kong's not so simple History
The time is 1841, and the British have won the the first Opium war <sub><sup>(Mmmm)</sup></sub> against China. What do they get? Hong Kong.  

***Why'd the war happen?***  
The war broke out after Qing-dynasty China attempted to crack down an [illegal opium trade](https://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/trading/story/trade/4tradingplaces.html) that led to widespread addiction in China.   

However it was more of a lending than a total takeover as under the terms of the treaty, China would regain the control of its leased lands on July 1, 1997. And they did (not entirely tho).  
Hong Kong wasn't the same, it had become a communist land under British and even the [declaration](https://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/joint3.htm) that they signed, agreed that China would give some political and social autonomy through a "**One country, two systems**" policy for 50 year period.  

Which is nice, and even the chinese citizens like it. To an extent that 100,000 chinese found [refuge in Hong Kong](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2125451/explainer-how-hong-kong-has-decades-been-magnet-refugees) after the communist party took power.

## Extradition Bill of 2019
***But why would this thing of 1841-1997 even come up now?***   
Glad you asked. That is because all this came up last year year with people protesting against the
