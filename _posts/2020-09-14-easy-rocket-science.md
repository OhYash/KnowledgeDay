  "It's rocket science" is said for something difficult. What if Rocket science
  itself isnt. Find out...

Howdy? I hear California is on fire! More than 3% of the state‚Äôs roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 **also** the largest wildfire season. (Remember, the Australian fires happened this year itself). Nature is doing it‚Äôs best to clean up this set of species of the earth, to pave way for the next life.  
  
Which calls in the need to escape the place, while we can. Today‚Äôs article aims to address that.  
  
Today‚Äôs topic is exciting! Because it works one of the bleeding edges or say the peak of what engineering has achieved so far. And still has a lot to be progressed with. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you think it‚Äôs very nerdy, because once you catch the basic of explorations and science behind the outer space. There‚Äôs no doubt you‚Äôre gonna be reading and exploring more.  
  
I personally started reading bits about space and rocket science out of interest last year only. Probably around the same time. And I can confirm it ain‚Äôt as boring as I always thought it‚Äôd be.  
  
I also covered an article on Elon Musk‚Äôs businesses, which includes SpaceX ‚Äì the only private Space exploration business which has managed to beat a lot of space agencies. Be sure to check it out [here](https://telegra.ph/First-Uber-then-the-driver-06-14).  
  
Behold this issue covers what makes a rocket do that ‚Äì escape the land. With data sourced directly from [NASA‚Äôs website](https://cutt.ly/pfPp8mK ). Maybe we could create rockets of our own.  

# Aeronautical vs Aerospace

So I attempted the [EF Standard English Test](https://cutt.ly/MfPsc4y) yesterday and it had one part in the listening section talking about rocket science, coincidental? Maybe.  

It‚Äôll be a good idea to share what the scientist shared there.  

Both Aeronautical and Aerospace streams deal with non-living flying objects, with the potential to carry humans. The difference is, in brief, **aeronautical** deals with flights **in** earth‚Äôs atmosphere, while **aerospace** covers both atmospheric and outer space realms.  

*Question. Why not deal with **only** outer space in the Aerospace field?*  
Good question. But if you think about it, we can‚Äôt ignore the fact that to get into space, we have to go **through** the atmosphere. And none of the principles relating to air pressure and drag (air friction) apply outside of our atmosphere.  
  
The smart guys at the research centers have to take both into account.  

## Alright, now the body science
  
As with many other things, the universal rule applies to rockets too: _Size doesn‚Äôt matter_. What‚Äôs important is to build them in a particular shape. Your rocket should have a long cylindrical body, a nose cone, and a propellant system to push the rocket. <sub><sup>(Don‚Äôt get distracted, I‚Äôm talking about rockets only)</sup></sub>  

The body is the main section of the rocket, this holds the main electronics needed to control large rockets, in some cases humans or a car too.    
  
The nose cone helps make air go sideways while the rocket is zooming out of the virus-ridden planet.
The propellant system obviously contains the fuel and oxidizers to provide oxygen so the fuel can burn.

## What makes it fly?
 
When a rocket is in flight, four forces act on it: **weight**, **thrust**, and two aerodynamic forces: **drag** and **lift**.  

**Weight** obviously is units of how much the gravity loves the rocket.  
**Thrust** is the propulsion system‚Äôs reply to gravity, it pushes the rocket up <sub><sup>(usually)</sup></sub>.  
**Drag** is air‚Äôs reply to gravity. (The air friction)  
**Lift** is what takes you from the ground to the cinema hall, in malls. jk, <s>it‚Äôs some sort of aerodynamic force which acts at a 90-degree angle to the direction</s>  
**Update** *(pointed out by [Saurabh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabh-bagare/), Rocket Scientist)*: lift is for controlling the rocket with free stream air hugging it from the sides - i.e. perpendicular to the rocket.  
  
And that‚Äôs not all. If you saw the work gravity somewhere, you know Newton‚Äôs gonna come and put rules and regulations on the table. Enter Newton‚Äôs laws of motion:  

**1st Law *(Law of Inertia)***: The rocket will stay on the launchpad until a force blasts it off. <sub><sup>(Yeah, these lazy bums need fire in the butt too)</sup></sub>  

**2nd Law *(F=ma)***: All the forces acting on the rocket form all sorts of directions. They define the mass of the rocket at any time. That is varying because as the rocket burns off its fuel, the mass of the rocket will decrease.  

**3rd law *(Every force has equal and opp...)***: The rocket moves in a direction (up), against the gas. Which in turn is pushes downwards. (They also call the rocket engines ‚Äúreaction engines‚Äù because of that)  

## Awesome! Off I go to make a rocket now

But‚Ä¶ wait, we didn‚Äôt discuss how to make it go up instead of in some other direction. Because face it, little instability and you‚Äôll see gravity directing the rocket‚Äôs path. And if the science of bad luck is to be believed in, the pointy nose guy will be running towards **you** in no time.  

To make it stable, you gotta take care of the center of gravity (the center of mass) and the center of pressure.

The **center of gravity(`cg`)** is the point where the rocket can be perfectly balanced.  
The **center of pressure(`cp`)** on the other hand only exists when the air is flowing past the rocket in a flight. It‚Äôs the location with an average of drag forces.  

I‚Äôll save your time and tell you what‚Äôs important. To make the rocket stable, the center of pressure has to be behind the center of gravity. This means your best bet is to push `cg` towards the nose and `cp` towards the bottom ‚Äì the wings ‚Äì the propulsion system.  
  
*Protip*: Learn from the badminton shuttle. Put weight in the nose to bring the `cg` towards the top.  
  
That‚Äôs it, we have enough information to make a rocket and soon put up a competition for NASA. Muahahaha üòà
