Hey there,

Welcome to the 32<sup>nd</sup> Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue. Hope you are doing great.  

It's December! The end of the year, and it's time to look ba-

Geez. I don't waana look back. This year has affected everyone, everywhere<sub><sup>(except antarctica)</sup></sub>.  

Speaking of antactica, it's been a while since I've looked at the map. Well, in the times when travelling can be deadly, one would keep it away.  
But let's do a quick run of the **map facts** that are not widely discussed. Did you know about these before? ðŸ‘‡  
## My land! No, mine!
^ Language of the dogs. And the lions. And kids. And apparently, Countries too.  
Just like the jokes and memes, there is no way you can draw a map without offending someone. There's just too many disagreements on borders of different countries that just won't come to a conslusion on where really the border extends out to.    
You'd think there's one or two edges here and there, but [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_disputes) from wikipedia lists over 100+ disputes globally. Most of those being from the Asian continent.  

> **But how do you differentiate that on the existing map we follow? What about google maps?**

Good question. Speaking of google maps. They can't just decide a border by themselves when the countries just haven't solved the disputes. That is why they do what's called a pro-internet-company move.  
The google maps is not the same for everyone. **You see what your country belives is true.** Yup. Google maps draws up differently based on the country you're in, just to satisfy everyone. I'll take my own country for examples.  

### Arunachal Pradesh/South Tibet
Depending on where you look at the Google Maps from, this will be drawn as per your liking. For india this land is Arunachal Pradesh. But if looked from China, it becomes a part of Tibet. And for the rest of the world, both! With border drawn with dotted lines.

### Pakistan/India/China over Kashmir
Ah this is a popular one. Atleast for the southern asia zone. For the uninitiated, Jammu & Kashmir is like the hot girl of lands and literally every country around wants it. Well there's more to it, but I'm trying keep politics out of here.   

So, J&K particularly is interesting because Pakistan, India, and China together are in disagreement about the borders and won't accept on who owns what. As a result, multiple dotted lines in google maps for other's to see.

See the dotted lines in the picture above? That is the area that Pakistan, and China claim out of India.

Again, there are more blurry borders, and the undecided borders are visible from country. So, if you know about the border dispute of your country and would like to see how the GMaps is from outside, just use a VPN to virtually change your location.

## Objects on the map are not proportionally scaled
Here's a question. How can they draw the world map on a flat paper or say how does google map show flat view of the world?  
_Because the world is flat!_  

Umm, well I'm not one of _them_ but as far as my logic goes. The world is round and to print the round on a flat rectangle plane surface will affect the sizing of stuff. And it does. The map standard globally followed is called [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection), presented by Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. Which became a standard because it's [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map_projection), meaning the angles, shapes and local directions are preserved when drawing round sourface on flat. As a side effect, the Mercator projection inflates the size of objects. This inflation is very small near the equator but accelerates with increasing latitude to become infinite at the poles.  

If that almost got you sleeping, I have a beautiful example. Look at this map. Greenland and India are highlighted.  
Which highlighted portion of land is bigger?  
![Greenland and India highlighted on map]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/greenland_india_orig.png)
  
But...  
![Google Land area of Greenland and India]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/greenland_vs_india_area.jpeg)
  
Unless you knew about it before, this could come as a surprise.  
Now here is greenland overlayed on India with actual size ratio.  
![Greenland overlay on India]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/greenland_india_together.png)

Which also should clear up the fact that Russia is indeed a big country. But not as enormously big as it looks. Here's a animatin from wikipedia showing proportions of apparent size and real size.

Waana play yourself with country sizes? [thetruesize.com](https://thetruesize.com/) allows you to size countries and compare at same levels.

Thanks for coming in. I love to write for you.
