Geez. I don't waana look back. This year has affected everyone, everywhere<sub><sup>(except antarctica)</sup></sub>.  

Speaking of antactica, it's been a while since I've looked at the map. Well, in the times when travelling can be deadly, you'd better keep it away.  
But let's do a quick run of the **map facts** that are not widely discussed. Did you know about these before? ðŸ‘‡

Just like the jokes and memes, there is no way you can draw a map without offending someone. There's just too many disagreements on borders of different countries that just won't come to a conslusion on where really the border extends out to.    
You'd think there's one or two edges here and there, but [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_disputes) from wikipedia lists over 100+ disputes globally. Most of those being from the Asian continent.

Good question. Speaking of google maps. They can't just decide a border by themselves when the countries just haven't solved the disputes. That is why they do what's called a pro-internet-company move.  
The google maps is not the same for everyone. **You see what your country belives is true.** Yup. Google maps draws up differently based on the country you're in, just to satisfy everyone. I'll take my own country for examples.
