*Hey there, Hi, I'm ready to die.*

How's it going? Corona only sounds like a buzzword now. Anyway, here's to another week of Knowledge Day and if you are reading this, then it means my Blog is finally live on the new domain! WooHoo!

head off to <https://knowledgeday.in> to check it out!

After all the lessons on rocket building, tech behind self driving cars', and what not I have come back with another issue taking stories of people who have exploited the system. So let's just get to it real quick.

# Scandals you should 
## Emissiongate
Remember Volkawagen from [issue #26](), and it's kids (Audi, Prosche, VW itself)? Well lets zoom a little back - 2015 and there was an interesting discovery on their diesel vehicles.  
Dubbed the "**Diesel dupe**" or "**Emissiongate**", in September 2015, the **EPA** found that many VW vehicles were fitted with a "**defeat device**" - that could detect when the vehicle is being tested, and changing performance accordingly to improve results.  
VW admitted that about 11 million cars worldwide, including eight million in Europe were fitted with so-called "defeat device". Smart play, on a global scale.  
The hightest number of cars fitted with this smart device were in European region, where the actual emissions were in legal range - not much of a fine there but they did have to call back all millions of cars and fix them. 
They were also fined for **$2.8 Billions** in the **US** and **$70 Millions** in **India** among many other countries.
As of June 2020, they'd poured Billions in fines, penalties, financial settlements into this, but possibly still less infront of the profits they'd made false selling millions of cars for nobody knows how long.
