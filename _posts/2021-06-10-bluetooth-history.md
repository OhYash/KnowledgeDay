Hey there,

Welcome to the <strong>41<sup>st</sup></strong> issue of Knowledge•Day!

Hope you're doing awesome. I'm here struggling with the peak summer heat in the driest state of the country, [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan). Hotness that I didn't ask for, but here we are.  

What I do ask for, here, is for you to share. This newsletter issue with friends - if you like it ofcourse. And I hope you do, for today's issue is about a very common yet overlooked technology.  

Btw, I gotta say, I've subscribed to Pulse newsletter by [Ben](https://twitter.com/PerspectiveIX) and his [last issue](https://perspectiveix.substack.com/p/the-curiosity-itch) is just marvelous. Worth a share, really.!  

Now let's just get to it, shall we?

# ᚼ+ᛒ = Bluetooth

I'm guessing you're listening to some music right now, and I'm also guessing it's over a pair of headphones. Finally, I belive it's not wired to your phone.  
Well, I could be wrong with the first guess itself, but hey! I'm doing that as I write this!  

The year is 1994, all devices communicated using cables (Serial or USB). Infrared existed back in the time. However, that required line-of-sight, meaning you had to “aim” the two devices at each other during the data transfer.  

_"Bluetooth fixes this."_, said Dr. Haartsen at Ericsson back in 1994, and put forth this little tech that had an ambition to become the unified standard mode of communication for all kind of electronics - phones, computers, and various accessories.

All innovation and no use. It took 6 years to produce first bluetooth-enabled phone (and wireless keyboard/mouse). The [Sony T36](https://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_t36-190.php) was unveiled in 2000. But... then the phone was cancelled. And then it took one more year for a bluetooth-enabled phone to hit the stores, the [Sony T39](https://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_t39-252.php).  

The **first generation Bluetooth** worked within 10m diameter of space, and it's speed tapped out at 721 Kbps.

> P.S. GPS receiver made it to phones before bluetooth did. [Benefone Esc](https://www.gsmarena.com/benefon_esc!-44.php), 1999, was the first GPS-enabled phone.

Couple years later, in 2005, **Bluetooth 2.0** was unveiled. Which tripled the speed upto 2.1 Mbps.  
Fancy huh? Hear this now, in 4 years they even beat that with **Bluetooth 3.0 HS** acheiving upto 24 Mbps! Over 11x speed growth.  

Or was it?  

Here's a catch: The HS was essentially **Wifi** doing the speedy magic with standard bluetooth _only_ there to make a connection.  

Good game, but there was one problem, wifi consumes significantly more power than bluetooth does. So, they figured it's better to keep the Wifi technology separate.  

> This small [experiment](https://www.clearevo.com/ecodroidlink/bluetooth_vs_wifi_on_android_battery_consumption/index.html) tries to practically find the power consumption difference on a android phone running youtube over Wifi vs over Bluetooth. 

The next version of bluetooth came up with a whooping **1 Mbps top speed!!**

_**What ?!**_. 

Yes, **Bluetooth 4.0**, aka Bluetooth Low Energy, came in 2010 was slower than Bluetooth 2.0.  

It gets crazier, Bluetooth 4 wasn't bluetooth at all.

_**Wut?**_

There was an independent project started at Nokia under the name Wibree, but that would be incorporated into the next generation of Bluetooth.

What's the win? It's in the name - **Low energy**. It was a lot more power efficient than the previous versions. Allowing it to be used in really small battery powered appliances (Fitness sensors, health care devices and the likes).   

Now, with this low energy as base they improved on speed and range. And they did. In 2016, **Bluetooth 5.0** was unveiled, increasing the range significantly - 240m with line of sight and up to 40m indoors. And at closer ranges, the speeds were double to that of it's predecessor at 2 Mbps. 

This is just enough to provide good range and decent speeds for most use cases while keeping the power consumption low.  
And we have Wifi, independently improving itself for high speed usecases. Like Netflix and chill.
