Hey there,

Welcome to the <strong>41<sup>st</sup></strong> issue of Knowledgeâ€¢Day!

Hope you're doing awesome. I'm here struggling with the peak summer heat in the driest state of the country, [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan). Hotness that I didn't ask for, but here we are.  

What I do ask for, here, is for you to share. This newsletter issue with friends - if you like it ofcourse. And I hope you do, for today's issue is about a very common yet overlooked technology.
