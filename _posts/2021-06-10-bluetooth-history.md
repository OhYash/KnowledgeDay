Hey there,

Welcome to the <strong>41<sup>st</sup></strong> issue of Knowledge•Day!  

Hope you're doing awesome. I'm here struggling with the peak summer heat in the driest state of the country, [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan). The hotness that I didn't ask for, but here we are.  

What I do ask for, here, is for you to share. This newsletter [issue](https://knowledgeday.in/bluetooth-history/) with friends - if you like it of course. And I hope you do, for today's issue is about a very common yet overlooked technology.  

Btw, I gotta say, I've subscribed to the Pulse newsletter by [Ben](https://twitter.com/PerspectiveIX) and his [last issue](https://perspectiveix.substack.com/p/the-curiosity-itch) is just marvelous. Worth a read I must say.!  

Now let's just get to it, shall we?

# ᚼ+ᛒ = Bluetooth

I'm guessing you're listening to some music right now, and I'm also guessing it's over a pair of headphones. Finally, I believe it's not wired to your phone.    
Well, I could be wrong with the first guess itself, but hey! I'm doing that as I write this!  
Now, let's get to the story.  

The year was 1994, all devices communicated using cables (Serial or USB). Infrared existed back in the time. However, that required line-of-sight, meaning you had to “aim” the two devices at each other during the data transfer.  

_"Bluetooth fixes this."_ said Dr. Haartsen (at Ericsson office) and put forth this little tech that had the ambition to become the unified standard mode of communication for all kinds of electronics - phones, computers, and various accessories.  

But it was all innovation and no use. It took 6 years to produce the **first Bluetooth-enabled phone** (and wireless keyboard/mouse). The [Sony T36](https://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_t36-190.php) was unveiled in 2000. But... the phone was canceled due to some issues. And then it took one more year for a Bluetooth-enabled phone to hit the stores, the [Sony T39](https://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_t39-252.php).

_Sony T39, the first Bluetooth-enabled device to hit the stores._

The **first-generation Bluetooth** worked within 10m diameter of space, and its speed tapped out at 721 Kbps.  

> P.S. GPS receiver made it to phones before Bluetooth did. [Benefone Esc](https://www.gsmarena.com/benefon_esc!-44.php), 1999, was the first GPS-enabled phone.  

A couple of years later, in 2005, **Bluetooth 2.0** was unveiled. Which tripled the speed up to 2.1 Mbps.  
Fancy huh? Hear this now, in 4 years they even beat that with **Bluetooth 3.0 HS** achieving up to **24 Mbps!** Over 11x speed growth.   

Or was it the case?  

Here's a catch: The Bluetooth part of Bluetooth HS was _only there_ to make a **_wifi connection_**, which would do the speedy magic.  

Good game, but there was one problem, wifi consumes **_significantly more power_** than Bluetooth does. So, they figured its better to keep the Wifi technology separate.  

> This small [experiment](https://www.clearevo.com/ecodroidlink/bluetooth_vs_wifi_on_android_battery_consumption/index.html) tries to practically find the power consumption difference on an android phone running youtube over Wifi vs over Bluetooth. (Not the most accurate, as the screen and the OS+apps would be eating most of the power, but you get the gist)  

The next version of Bluetooth came up with a whooping **1 Mbps top speed!!**  

_**What ?!**_.  

Yes, **Bluetooth 4.0**, aka Bluetooth Low Energy, came in 2010 was slower than Bluetooth 2.0.  

It gets crazier, Bluetooth 4 **_wasn't Bluetooth at all._**  

_**Whaaat ?!!**_  

Yes, there was an independent project started at Nokia under the name **_Wibree_**, which was incorporated into the this 4.0 generation of Bluetooth.  

What's the win? It's in the name - **Low energy**.  It was a lot more power-efficient than the previous versions. Allowing it to be used in really small battery-powered appliances (Fitness sensors, health care devices, and the likes).    

Now, with this low energy product as a base, they could refocus on speed and range. And they did. In 2016, **Bluetooth 5.0** was unveiled, increasing the range significantly - 240m with line of sight and up to 40m indoors. And at closer ranges, the speeds were double that of its predecessor at 2 Mbps.   

This is just enough to provide a good range and decent speeds for most use cases while keeping the power consumption low.   
And we have Wifi, independently growing, for high-speed use cases - like Netflix and chill.

This was Bluetooth history in 3 minutes. It might feel a bit rushed, but thats what happens when you squeeze history of 25 years into a 3 minutes text.  
If you liked it, please do [consider sharing it]({{site.baseurl}}/bluetooth-history/), which helps me get more feedback and satisfaction for my efforts. :-)   

Btw, there's also a comments zone for you to speak forth. Just saying ;-)
