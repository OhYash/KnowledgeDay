Hey there,

Welcome back to the 38<sup>th</sup> Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue. Hope you're doing awesome. If not, then you're just a decision away.  

Anyway, long time no _read_. Past few weeks have been laborious. But now that's no longer a problem.  
**Why?** Because I made a switch. To a more humane environment. I'd like to share that I now work at [Digital Guardian](https://digitalguardian.com/)'s Hyderabad office.  
I'll work on improving and enhancing their nDLP (Network Data Loss Protection) software.  

Speaking of networks. It's so amazing it enables this awesome thing called **The Internet** which allows us to send e-mails, thanks to which now you're reading this newsletter. <3  

Today, we talk about how this amzing thing materialized. Join me.

# The Internet
Believe or not, internet is what saved you in this lockdown. Imagine, being locked inside your home for 6 months.. Without any internet.  
I can't. Well, at this time, thanks to work from home I spend 24 hours under the same roof. And obviously in WiFi - at all times.  

But how did this thing happen? Who created internet? What was the intent? Let's dive in.

# Sputnik Scare
We use the internet to share all our emotions with tech giants now. But it itself was born out of scare.  
Scare of the **Soviet Union**. Yep.  

During 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first man made satellite into the orbit. The **Sputnik**.  
While it did not do much being the first successful proof of concept. But was an alarming sign for the US, positioning them a large step behind the rivals, who could win the [Cold War](https://tenor.cards/?p=VGhlIENvbGQgV2FyIHJpdmFscnkgYmV0d2VlbiB0aGUgVW5pdGVkIFN0YXRlcyBhbmQgdGhlIFNvdmlldCBVbmlvbiBsYXN0ZWQgZm9yIGRlY2FkZXMgYW5kIGxlZCB0aGUgdHdvIHN1cGVycG93ZXJzIHRvIHRoZSBicmluayBvZiBudWNsZWFyIGRpc2FzdGVyLg==) with this scientific advancement.  

Americans were afraid that the Soviets could cut off their telephone links. A big no-no for the time when long wired telephones was the only way of communication for the military. They had to do something.  

# Birth of the ARPAnet
In 1962, a scientist fro M.I.T. and ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) brought up the idea of a "galactic network" of computers that could talk to each other.  
This was bested by another Scientish in 1965, who developed a way of sending information in pieces that he called "packet Switching" - still the base for today's networking.

> Packet switching breaks data down into blocks, or packets, before sending it to its destination. That way, each packet can take its **own route** from place to place.  
Packets taking their own route is important. Otherwise ARPAnet would have been just as vulnerable to enemy attacks as the phone system.
