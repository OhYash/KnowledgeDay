Hey there,

Welcome back to the 38<sup>th</sup> Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue. Hope you're doing awesome. If not, then you're just a decision away.  

Anyway, long time no _read_. Past few weeks have been laborious. But now that's no longer a problem.  
**Why?** Because I made a switch. To a more humane environment. I'd like to share that I now work at [Digital Guardian](https://digitalguardian.com/)'s Hyderabad office.  
I'll work on improving and enhancing their nDLP (Network Data Loss Protection) software.  

Speaking of networks. It's so amazing it enables this awesome thing called **The Internet** which allows us to send e-mails, thanks to which now you're reading this newsletter. <3  

Today, we talk about how this amzing thing materialized. Join me.
