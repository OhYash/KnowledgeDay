Hey there,

Welcome back to the **38<sup>th</sup> Knowledge•Day issue**. Hope you're doing awesome. If not, then you're just a decision away.  

Anyway, long time no _read_. Past few weeks have been laborious. But now that's no longer a problem.  
**Why?** Because I made a switch. To a more humane environment. I'd like to share that I now work at [Digital Guardian](https://digitalguardian.com/)'s Hyderabad office.  
I'll work on improving and enhancing their nDLP (Network Data Loss Protection) software.  

Speaking of networks. It's so amazing it enables this awesome thing called **The Internet** which allows us to send e-mails, thanks to which now you're reading this newsletter. <3  

Today, we talk about how this amazing thing materialized. Join me.

--------

# The Internet
Believe or not, internet is what saved you in this lockdown. Imagine, being locked inside your home for 6 months.. Without any internet.  
I can't. Well, at this time, thanks to work from home I spend 24 hours under the same roof. And obviously under the refuge of WiFi - at all times!  

But how did this thing happen? Who created internet? What was the intent? Today it's all about that.  

## Sputnik Scare
We use the internet to share all our emotions with tech giants now. But it itself was born out of scare.  
Scare of the **Soviet Union**. Yep.  

During 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first man made satellite into the orbit. The **Sputnik**.  
While it did not do much being the first successful proof of concept. But was an alarming sign for the US, positioning them at the rear of the rivals, who could win the [Cold War](https://tenor.cards/?p=VGhlIENvbGQgV2FyIHJpdmFscnkgYmV0d2VlbiB0aGUgVW5pdGVkIFN0YXRlcyBhbmQgdGhlIFNvdmlldCBVbmlvbiBsYXN0ZWQgZm9yIGRlY2FkZXMgYW5kIGxlZCB0aGUgdHdvIHN1cGVycG93ZXJzIHRvIHRoZSBicmluayBvZiBudWNsZWFyIGRpc2FzdGVyLg==) with this scientific advancement.  

Americans were afraid that the Soviets could cut off their telephone links. A big no-no for the time when long wired telephones was the only way of communication for the military. They had to do something.  

## Birth of the ARPAnet
In 1962, a scientist fro M.I.T. and ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) brought up the idea of a "galactic network" of computers that could talk to each other.  
This was bested by another Scientish in 1965, who developed a way of sending information in pieces that he called "packet Switching" - still the base for today's networking.  

> **Packet switching** breaks data down into blocks, or packets, before sending it to its destination. That way, each packet can take its **own route** from place to place.    
Packets taking their own route is important. Otherwise ARPAnet would have been just as vulnerable to enemy attacks as the phone system.   

> Fun fact: The first message they tried to send across the ARPAnet was "LOGIN". Which was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network anyway: The Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters.  

## Expansion plan
Can't just be partying with two computers talking. By the end of 1969, the _internet_ had grown wide communicating **4 computers**!    

_4 is too less._   

Sure enough.  
In 1971, they had added University of Hawaii's [ALOHAnet](https://www.eng.hawaii.edu/about/history/alohanet/) and added more computers. Thats when the internet's vertices started becoming more difficult to integrate.   

What followed next as a resolution was the concept of "[virtual handshaking](https://networksigma.com/tcp-3-way-handshake/#:~:text=TCP%20uses%20a%20three-way%20handshake%20to%20make%20a,is%20established,%20data%20is%20transferred%20between%20the%20devices.)" and the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** that you must have heard about. The computer scientist Vinton Cerf was behind this remarkable solution. He also introduced another protocol, known as the **Internet Protocol (IP)**. Forming the commonly used acronym TCP/IP.   

## The World Wide Web
Cerf's TCP/IP brought solidity to the internet and then throught the 1980s researchers used it to send files and messages.  

Tim didn't like this.  

**Who Tim?**   

Tim Berners-Lee, a computer programmer, in 1991 introduced the World Wide Web. The one I used to fetch this story for you. Beners lee created this "web" of information that everyone can consume.  

## Enter the browsers
That was the internet. This led to more advancement and in 1992 Mosaic browser emerged. This is when _the internet got viral_. One thing led to another and by the start of the 21st century the dot-com boomed followed by a crash - Another interesting story which I have covered in my [issue 36](https://knowledgeday.in/dot-com-bubble/). A must read if this was even slightest bit interesting.  

Off I go now. See you in the next issue.   
Oh, and please do share this newsletter or maybe just the blog to someone you think would enjoy reading. It's free information.
