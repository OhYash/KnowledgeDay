Hey there,  

How's it going?  
Y'know, I finally managed to have a small vacation after months. I went to a famous hillstaion in Uttrakhand, India - Nainital. Which is named based on the lake the city surrounds, the Naini lake.  
I visited it for 2 days, and boy was the timing perfect. The monsoon weather was at it's best position, with clouds engulfing the city and the mountains on and off the entire day.  

Not much to write here to explain, I let the pictures do the talking.

Alright, you're sold. There's no reason to not be. I'd be happy to visit again even though it's only been little over a week since I have come back from there.  
Alright, enough teasing with my hill escape. Let's get to the today's topic. It's been a while since we shed some interest in a physics based fact right? Last was about [Making rockets](https://knowledgeday.in/easy-rocket-science/), shared last September.  

Phew..

**Sailboats** are fundamentally very simple boats. The sails(wings for them) catch part of the wind. The pressure from the wind gets sent down to the vessel throught the hull, this moves the boat forward. (or backward, or sideways, depending on which way the sailor has the sail directed to the wind).  

That may sound kinda difficult, but a youtube video assured me it isn't. I'll go with their word and assume until I'm there to experience myself.  
We here are present to discuss the science behind that, for, y'know, opening the knowledge scope and driving the next conversation with friends.  

# wind to drive directions
If you put a big ball in a waterbody, it'll go where the wind is going. (Or where the dolphins wanna take it). But often you don't waana go where the wind is moving. <sub><sup>(Oh you just had a breakup? Just let the wind do it's work then)</sup></sub>  

You know the sails can be rotated, now the professionals know the directions to keep their sails so as to move their boat in a certain direction with respect to the wind.  
The sail direction is so effective that they can **move the boat towards the wind, using the wind.** (Well, not directly into the wind, but to some angle to it, then copy the snake's zig-zag movement to go into the wind direction, eventually)  ``

# Outracing the wind
But we are here to know how to beat someone in their own game. Are we gonna use motors? No. Are we gonna use fans? No. We're gonna use the same sails.  

At this point I'd bring two terminologies to the table. Apparent wind and True wind.
> When the wind around you is still, and you start biking and feel some wind on your face, that is called **Apparent wind**.  
> But when you're standig still, and feel some wind breezing through your face, this wind is called **True Wind**.  

When you keep the sails perpendicular to the true wind, your boat will gradually catch up to the speed of wind, no more, because there's no apparent wind acting on it. Put it in parallel to wind and you just provide no resistance for the wind to act on, and the boat will keep standing still.  

The game is in the middle, when the boat travels at an angle to the true wind, the apparent wind suddently generates a powerful force.  

-> To put it simply, the wind here is doing two things, it's pushing, but because of the angle of the sail there's also a part of wind that's dragging the boat further. This dragging is done with a force called _"lift"_.  
Yes, the same physics that allow airplanes to fly. The difference is airplanes lift up off the ground, while the boats lift parallel to the ground - as if they're flying sideways.  

-> To put it complexfully, there's also the sideways force and heeling force amongst a few more. Here's a top view of a sailboat with all aerodynamic forces in balance with hydrodynamic forces ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces_on_sails)):
![Aerodynamic forces in balance with hydrodynamic forces on a close-hauled sailboat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Boatforcestop.svg/845px-Boatforcestop.svg.png)  

Yeah. I'm not explaining that here.  

But really, the experienced sailors can feel this. They feel the forces, and know how to respond to it. The handling is delicate too, because you're trying to balance the boat as well while reaping maximum benefit with the max possible forces for speed. This keeps the boat at the verge of falling with one bad turn of the sail, with speeds greater than the wind itself.  

**Okay, I'm convinced. Now how much faster can they be with all that extra force?**  
There are sailboat cups organised at different parts of the world. Ofcourse you've watched one in the movie **Sturt Little**, but that was not a serious one.  
The America’s Cup sailboats are sleek and fast. The AC72 can travel almost three times the speed of the prevailing wind. On 18th June 2013, Emirates Team New Zealand recorded a speed of 50.8 mph (44.1 knots), with a wind speed of about 18 mph (15.6 knots).  

Boggles mind? Well, it's a good idea to have an experience for once, just let me know when you're off for one. I'd like to join too.

Welp, that's all for this issue.  

This is a fairly simple take on this psychology topic, and I really hope you like it. If you aren't subscribed to the newsletter, I highly recommend doing it - no spam, pure knowledge.  

Tschüss!
