Hey %first_name%,

Welcome to another Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue. October has started and I will be 23 in the coming few **minutes**(IST). Getting old damn.  

At this moment, I have a humble request for you.. Please share the newsletter, help it grow!  
All you gotta do is share this link -> <https://knowledgeday.imfast.io/>

I'm in the middle of a redesign of this email template. Which means the next email will look better.  
For now, let's get into today's text.

We all ofcourse know **Beats** headphones is owned by **Apple** since 2014 (If you didn't, now you do). And that Whatsapp, Instagram among many other things are owned by Facebook. But did you know **Android** was not built google in the first place and they acquired it along with the founder **Andy Rubin** (Andy is out of google now and has his own interesting story). And your JBLs are owned by **Samsung** (who owns Harman Kardon, who owns **JBL**).
Fun tech ownerships. But you'll be surprised to know how much all the world's top car makers are families.

## Who owns what -  Car brands

### Mini, Rolls-Royce
You'd think the cute little Coopers were independent, or if not mini then Rolls Royce definitely always seemed as the root. But no! They have a father, and it's **BMW**!

### Dodge, Alfa Romeo, Jeep, Maserati
Familiar names? Two of these are american and other two Italian. Obviously becomein American Italian Conglomerate. But who is the father? Next two names should clear that -> **Chrysler** is American and **Fiat** is Italian.

PS, They also owned 90% of Ferrari until 2014 - that's when Ferrari separated into independence.

### The big circle - Bentley, Audi, Skoda, Volkswagen, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti
WHAT? All those? Yes. You're seeing everything from public vehicles (Skoda, VW) to Luxury (Bentley) to Sports (Lambo, Bugatti) and all of these come under one packet. Waana know who's the parent? Take a guess.
Hint: It's the cheapest carmaker of this bunch ^.

And You're right. **Volkswagen** owns majority of cars we dream of maybe driving one day. This list is crazy and is not limited to the 7 above, these are just the most popular ones - globally.

### More?
Ofcourse. The above 3 groups don't define everything and businesses keep on buying businesses. **Tata** India owns **Jaguar** and **Land Rover**, **Hyundai** owns **Kia** too, **Daimler** owns both **Mercedes-Benz** and **Bharat-Benz**, and **Toyota** owns **Lexus** to name a few examples.

And these were just cars. Do we have same story with bikes too?
**Ducati** name rhymes with one of the sports car maker above... Just saying.
