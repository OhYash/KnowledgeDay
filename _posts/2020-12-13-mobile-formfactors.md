Hey there,

Welcome to the 34th KnowledgeDay issue. Hope you're doing great!

This light hearted issue, was requested for by [Samarth](), your fellow reader and a friend of mine. Today, we talk about some interesting shapes mobile phones have taken over the years.

Note that concepts the companies have shared before are way wierder and endless. While also being out of the scope for this issue.  
Let's get on to it.

*Not just a rectangle box*  
We've come a long way from early phones covering the entire side of our face, to now, well... That watch on the wrist paired with a wireless earphone is enough.  

## The land mine
Oldest of the bunch and probably is still there in your living room. You know these guys, entirely. These guys are Just lying there and have super high ringing volume.

> Adjoining fact: Many may believe that the American **Alexander Graham Bell** was the **inventor** of the phone. But it was in fact the Italian/American [**Antonio Meucci** that invented the phone in **1849**](https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/item/who-is-credited-with-inventing-the-telephone/). Alexander Graham Bell was however the first that acquired the patent of the technique, first in year 1876.

## The hand mine

*Yes, that's CJ's phone*

This thick boy shows first steps towards carryable phones. It didn't have much battery span, or range. But, well, did allow us to talk on the terrace.  

## bigger screen, then querty

Once the wire was removed. Priority shifted towards losing the fat and weight. All while increasing the screensize to accomodate java games. Wow full keyboard too. Reminds me of my [first windows mobile](https://www.gsmarena.com/amoi_e78-2037.php), I've given it countless hours playing NES emulated games. The querty was a bliss, and ex-blackberry users would definitely relate.   

## flip, slide
![Funky flip/slide action gif]()

Enter the action. Flip phones and the ones with slide had the cool of early 2000s. I know what you're thinking, it's come back with foldable screens, but is it as fun as before? No, it's delicate af.

## touch
![Touch screen]()

You're holding it. Nothign fancy anymore. Was a dream of chilhood Yash I remember.  

## camera popup, then flip

Once being confortable with touch. Starting 2014+ everyone started expanding screen real estate, and tried minimizing bezels on the front. Eveen stretched around a notch to have little-more screen on the front.  
But one day in 2018, **Vivo** came with another idea. Pop-up cameras. Vivo Nex was the first phone to have a pop-up camera.  
Asus took a stwp ahead and brought up a flip camera, which allowed them to use same cameras on the back and the front.  

## dual screen

Saving the front real estate is everyone's problem. Couple of them, mainly ZTE/Nubia brought up another approach. 

## Foldable screens

Latest in the trend, costs around the prices if motorcycles. But less thrill than what the motorcycles can give. Not recommended, but the riches can flaunt as they like.
P.S. I wrote about a fun Escobar surrouding the foldable phones. I think you'll like that.

## LG wing's T screen

If you've checked news recently. You'd know LG's heavily trying to create a little space that they can own (much like Sony), the latest is their phone with screen that swivels horizontally. Giving space for a secondary screen on the bottom.  
The win? Yeah well I'm trying to figure that out too.   

## Bonus: Samsung seems to be exploring pop-out display

Sounds like every other phone if you manhandle it right.  
But samsung recently filed a patent for a phone with a pop up flexible display.  
Guess why...  

The purpose is to make room for a speaker resonance chamber. Literally nothing else sounds useful here. Sounds like a good idea for audio entusiasts, but the audio enthusiasts also have better speakers to pick from.  

Can be a fail but it's not a real phone yet. It's just patented and they are experimenting.  

# The end
That's all folks, I end with a question.  
**Do you have a favorite form factor among the above? Which one would you like right now?**  
For me it'd be sliding touch with a physical keypad. Basically [FxTec Pro 1](https://www.fxtec.com/) but with keyboard from [Gemini PDA](https://store.planetcom.co.uk/products/gemini-pda-1).
