Hey there,  

Welcome to the issue #39 of Knowledge•Day.

All I can hope for is negative news in your family - in terms of covid.

With that, let's quickly step towards the actual issue for the time. This one is a particularly interesting piece to me.
Because I have been following the deal with it for a while.

Let's talk about the **Ubuntu touch**!
