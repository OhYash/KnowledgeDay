Hey there,  

You're probably well and doing good. I won't ask. But I have another question, how do you find the new template.?! Bitchin' right 😏.
Took me a little while to fixate on this design, and it's still not complete. There's no social connect icons for the starters.

But that's okay, it'll come in soon. You anyway never clicked on it in any of the previous emails I know 😒.

Doesn't matter, lets come to the topic. We all know humans are susceptible to Covod-19 virus and that includes Trump, even if [he believes otherwise](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1315316071243476997)🤦.  But you want can go out and not catch Corona Virus? Your Car!  

Tech Giants like Waymo(Alphabet), Uber, Tesla, and more have been investing heavily for years to enable the machines with wheels to run free of human control and not be a victim of human brutality - read "Road accidents".  

Being able to let AI decide our pathway and transport is a thing of future. But today, we look into how are they aiming to achieve it.

# How does it work - Self-driving cars
