Hey there,  

Yes, I'm late again. I blame my time management skills. But screw that, for I have a question: How do you find the new template.?!
Took me a little while to fixate on this design, and it's still not complete. There's no social connect icons for the starters.

But that's okay, it'll come in soon. You anyway never clicked on it in any of the previous emails I know ðŸ˜’.

Doesn't matter, lets come to the topic. We all know humans are susceptible to Covod-19 virus and that includes Trump, even if [he believes otherwise](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1315316071243476997)ðŸ¤¦.  But you want can go out and not catch Corona Virus? Your Car!  

Tech Giants like Waymo(Alphabet), Uber, Tesla, and more have been investing heavily for years to enable the machines with wheels to run free of human control and not be a victim of human brutality - read "Road accidents".  

Being able to let AI decide our pathway and transport is a thing of future. But today, we look into how are they aiming to achieve it.

# How does it work - Self-driving cars
In a nutshell, they work by understanding the environment and try to get to a destination without touching any thing in between.  
In a little more (yet still overview) detail, it's a five part process.

Let's quickly look at these one by one:
## 1. Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion
Two different tech to perform common functionality - Get sense of the environment around the car.
Computer Vision here refers to using camera to see the surroundings (or say eyes of the car) and sensor fusion refers to using sensors to understand the surroundings (lasers, radar and stuff).
These two work together to only learn the surroundings. Which also means this step can be performed offline if the car's processors are capable enough. (Generally not, they let the data centres and remote servers do all that part)

## 2. Localization
Correctly guessed, it's the GPS based localication to know the car's position on the globe. But that's not it, that part even a smartphone can do.  
This localization has to be synced with the surroundings data from step #1 to accurately define the car's position. Few feets off and you BatMobil would be running on the footpath.

## 3. Path Planning
Not just the GPS navigation. The path plannig here refers to the literal path the car would be running on.   
The current lane, and then where to switch lane because there's a crack in the road ahead. That all has to be planned.

## 4. Control
All the steps above relate to knowing and designing the path to the destination or say to the next exit.  
But what comes after knowledge? <sub><sup>(day!)</sup></sub> No. The DO comes after it. The car actually has to do something to go that path it just planned. That requires controlling the breaks, acceleration, steering and
