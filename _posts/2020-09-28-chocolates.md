# Let's talk about chocolates and benefits

Hey there,

You didn't particularly google this and either found a direct link from somewhere or your good friend who gets my mails weekly shared this link. I know, I know. And it's good to share. and you know what, you can get the newsletter directly in your inbox too. Just read to the bottom and you'll know what to do. Cut the middleman ;)

Alright, so let's begin with post number **25!** This is the quarter century milestone post! ðŸ¥³

Btw, this topic was suggested by **Vyshnavi**. Thank you sissy!

# Chocolates with benefits

<sub><sup>What do you mean *this rhymes with something else*?</sup></sub>
There are only handful number of people we meet in our lives who don't like chocolates in any form, or only like white chocolates. Well, I don't know any. If you do, share this article with them and they might as well change.

But what am I talking about, what does it even have to offer, other than taste?

## Chocolates for mood
Some food increase serotonin levels. Chocolate included. "Data reveals that the people who consume dark chocolate show **lower** symptoms of **depression** compared to those who don't eat chocolates at all. Nothing out of proportion is ever good and same applies to chocolate. Small amout of dark chocolate works well to keep you up beat." - Delnaaz T., Chief Dietitian at JHRC, Mumbai

Next time you feel low... Bournville is the answer.

## Chocolate as an aphrodisiac
Afro...what?
Chocolates tends to increase nitric oxide levels and contains an amino acid called **L-arginine** that promotes blood flow to the sexual organs proving itself effective natural sex enhancer.

It gained this reputation not by some hippie brand promoting chocolate flavored goods. But dates back into the historical western civilisation. Montezuma, an Aztec ruler was the first who tapped into this qualities of chocolate (Talk about **1500s** era). And then there were more rulers who became "**legendary lovers**"! <sub><sup>(No, not Lannisters)</sup></sub>  

Long story short, chocolate, is one of the world's finest aphrodisiacs. Second only to Champagne.

Reminder again: Overload yourself with chocolates and you'll gain weight. Which I think is not so good if your goal is this^^

## Chocolates as Sunscreen
Don't brown paint your face just yet. You gotta drink it. According to sciencenews.org, women who drank a cocoa drink rich in flavonoids made their skin look better and protected it from ultrviolet-light damage.

## But Which chocolate?
You probably have noticed I have been talking about dark chocolate and not the milk chocolate. That's because milk chocolate is high in sugar and fats (Contains about 30% cocoa). Dark chocolate with over 70% cocoa is considered healthiest with rich antioxidants, polyphenos and flavonoids, in easy language only dark chocolates carry the above benefits.
*Who eats dark chocolate? It's so untasty*;  
Chocolate has been cosumed unsweetened for 90% of its history. Beat that.

Oh, and about white chocolate? Well I never considered it chocolate. Annnd while researching for this article, I come to know... That it indeed is a misnomer! White chocolate does not contain any cocoa powder, so nothing above applies to it.  
But.. it effectively is milk, which isn't bad, so there's that.
