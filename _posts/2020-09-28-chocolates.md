# Chocolates with benefits

<sub><sup>Wdym "*this rhymes with something else*"?</sup></sub>
There are only handful number of people we meet in our lives who don't like chocolates in any form, or only like white chocolates. Well, I don't know any. If you do, share this article with them and they might as well change.

But what am I talking about, what does it even have to offer, other than taste?

## Chocolates for mood
Some food increase serotonin levels. Chocolate included. "Data reveals that the people who consume dark chocolate show lower symptoms of depression compared to those who don't eat chocolates at all. Nothing out of proportion is ever good and same applies to chocolate. Small amout of dark chocolate works well to keep you up beat." - Delnaaz T., Chief Dietitian at JHRC, Mumbai
