Hey there,

How are you doing? It's a new year, and America's seeing some fun times just at the starting. Trump's been thrown off of Twitter and Facebook and for some reason a free speach app gets smashed. _Parler_ is a twitter alternative that's been trying to make some space since it's launch in 2018 and suddenly get's removed by Google and Apple stores. Because a sizable community on the platform is Pro-trump and are unionizing.
Developers be like ðŸ¤·

Anyway, interesting things keep on happening everywhere, One of those is the popular dot-com bubble a crash that happened ~20 years ago.  
What crashed? What was the bubble, today we cover that. Join along.
