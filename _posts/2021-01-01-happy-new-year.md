Hey there,

Second chapter of the decade starts and I'm here to wish you a very **Happy New Year 2021**.   

This 2020 was an year filled with bad news and a ton of lessons. To me that's good in many ways, this year opened my eyes to numerous sides of what's happening around. For starters, an year ago, I didn't even know newsletters is something individuals do for hobby/bread-butter, but here I am. In the space that was unknown to me an year ago.  

This newsletter Knowledgeâ€¢Day is over 6 months old. And at the time of writing, goes out to 57 people. Including you, {{ receiver.fname }}.  

This is not a regular Knowledge day issue, just going through the other newsletters I've subscribed to gave me this idea of discussing how the year was to me. This email covers exactly that.  

If you're not interested, that's understandable, you can press back and get back to your life.   
If you are stickin' here, awesome! I'll try to keep this short.

# 2020: The year that changed the confort zone for everyone
_No seriously, even the introverts who claimed to be unaffected with lockdown as this changes nothing in their lifestyle are scratching their heads after all these months._  

## The beginning
I was supposed to start this year unconscious, on one of the beatches of Goa (also claimed to be Las Vegas of India. Not quite.)

**But what happened? Why didn't I?**
Because it's Goa. That's the rule: Goa trip plans are never executed.  
My own story is one of the many excuses that cancel up the Goa trips. I my case, I applied for two govenment exams that were supposed to be executed in the first weeks of Jan and Feb. And in the last days before the planned Goa trip, I started panicking about being unprepared. Also, the only friend that agreed to go along started panicking for his own reasons.  
All in all, Yash celebrated new years at the Gateway of India. Not bad, but could've been better.  

"_Next time_", I said to myself.  

Early days were just me preparing for the exams. In case you waana know the results: Negative. I should've enjoyed the days instead.  

Wasn't all dry though. I managed to vist Ctrl-Alt-Delete in Mumbai, an awesome crowd funded concert. Mostly indie artists, but they were awesome.  
Here's a little glimpse:
