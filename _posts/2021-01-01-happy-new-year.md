Hey there,

Second chapter of the decade starts and I'm here to wish you a very **Happy New Year 2021**.   

This 2020 was an year filled with bad news and a ton of lessons. To me that's good in many ways, this year opened my eyes to numerous sides of what's happening around. For starters, an year ago, I didn't even know newsletters is something individuals do for hobby/bread-butter, but here I am. In the space that was unknown to me an year ago.  

This newsletter Knowledgeâ€¢Day is over 6 months old. And at the time of writing, goes out to 57 people. Including you, {{ receiver.fname }}.  

This is not a regular Knowledge day issue, just going through the other newsletters I've subscribed to gave me this idea of discussing how the year was to me. This email covers exactly that.  

If you're not interested, that's understandable, you can press back and get back to your life.   
If you are stickin' here, awesome! I'll try to keep this short.
