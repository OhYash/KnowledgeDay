Hey there,

Welcome to the **40<sup>th</sup> Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue**!!  

If you did read through my [anniversary special issue](https://knowledgeday.in/kd-is-one/), you must've been expecting something new for today.  

If you didn't, what a bummer, but here's what I had for this: Starting this second year for the blogletter, I've decided to add a variant - called **KD TiLT**!  

What is it? Expansion of the word shall clarify a little:  

# TiLT - Things I Learned Today

Sick abbrevation right? It's underrated and I decided to keep this even if it's inaccurate.  

**Why inaccurate?**  

It implies I'll be sending this newsletter _everyday_, which I won't. If I had 10 hands, I could have. But alas, I'm facing the average human limitations.  

**But what is it?**

Long story short, TiLT will contain some of my handpicked findings over the internet. No, don't think of it as one more link sharing board. Most of my handpicks won't show up on your feeds anyway, plus, you get tl;dr(s) for all of em.  

Sounds good? Sounds great to me! Let's get on it!!

Alrighty, that was it for the first KD TiLT issue. How did you find this first TiLT issue? Let me know. Also, now you get the gist of what it is, I see this as another opportunity to share **your** awesome finding.  
Hit me up anytime if there's something you think is worth sharing. (Hint: there's atleast 5 such exciting things you come across everyweek)
