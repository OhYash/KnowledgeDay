_Hey there, Hi, I'm ready to die_  

Welcome to a special Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue.  

This is again late, and I'd blame the winter lazyness for that.ðŸ¤·  

But do you know who's not lazy? Robots!  

So we picked up a yet another random topics. This is the first post after the [6 months anniversary](https://knowledgeday.in/half-year/)!  

# Boston's Robots
Here's a fun company you've heard of. Well, in real their work is not so fun. This is one of the many companies working towards building the first set of universal human replacements for physical activites.  
Competitors include Amazon Robotics, Agility Robotics amongst more...  

What we look for today is some of the cheeky robots they've made and the "Whys" behind the designs too.   

## Handle

A literal handle. That can move around. This robot is a mobile hand carrier that has two legs. But both of them have wheels. Effectively, I'd call it skater robot. But unlike us with skates... being faster but more vulenerable to falls. These huge wheels on legs combine the rough-terrain capabilities of legs with the efficiency of wheels.  
The form factor allows handle to have human like space requirements. The robot performs real time superior balancing using it's bee-like tail. Superior because unlike us, it's legs are wheels.  

### The Purpose
The robot is made to transport things around in a small area. Which a human can totally do. But unlike humans, they don't get tired. Although I do think it looks a bit slower than what a forklift car can carry on flat lands.

## Cheetah 

Easy guess by the name. It's the the Boston dynamics' solution for the specific situation which assumes Usain Bolt could be a criminal and something has to be able to be able to catch him in narrow roads.

The robotic cheetah, unlike the real one probably can run for longer and listen to humans' orders <sup><sub>(for now)</sub></sup>.
