Hey there,

Welcome to the **42<sup>nd</sup> Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue**!!  

Today's issue wasn't very easy to compile. You know why?

Probably my longest companion, lasted over 30 times my longest relationship, had been the guinea for almost all of my experiments, explorations(soft and hard), countless benchmarks. Basically all that I didn't do on my phone, I did on this particular laptop.  

I wasn't very nice with it ever, this boy came into the wrong hands. I understand you may also have opened your own laptop for replacing the RAM or Harddisk, or maybe you opened it further to clean the internals yourself and touch and feel the brain of it, the processor. I do that, to almost all the devices I've owned, desktops(ofcourse), laptops, phones, tablets...

But, I'm pretty damn sure, you've never purposefully dropped your notebook from a table's height just to see it's strength.! Totally not recommended, and the noise was 2.3KGs(5 lbs) loud. I still don't know what was going on in my mind in that BYOD lab, but this young man survived. Nothing changed actually. But, the sound it made when it hit the floor, man that sound pulled out my soul.  That was the day I stopped physical experiments on this, my boy has served 5 years since, before giving up 2 days ago.

**What did I do two days ago?**  
Nothing actually, I was just using it for, you know, the regular stuff - web browsing, chats and had two VSCode instances open just to make the RAM uncomfortable. (I use Sublime text for programming).  
And it hung. Much like Windows 98 era. I was like _"Okay... Maybe I could do with one less VSCode instance"_, and tried to restart it.
It wouldn't. No bios erros, no beeping sound, no screen tearing, nothing. Just the keyboard lights that light up.  
Looks like a RAM issue, right?  
That's what I thought. But No. I opened and swapped that too, same situation. Which leaves me with either: 
1. CPU's gone; or
2. Something on the Motherboard  

Neither of which are cheap replacements. And, hence my tweet today.  

Alright, maybe you didn't open this to read about my (arguable) _love_ for almost a decade old piece of electronics. Let's get to the thing of the current.  

This is the second issue of KD TiLT! If you don't know this variant of the newsletter is designed specifically to share things I can't write better than my sources over the internet.  

Let's get onto it!
