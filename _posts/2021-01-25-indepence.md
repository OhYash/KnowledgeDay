Hey there,

Having fun there? Ofcourse you are, because why not!

I welcome you to another Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue. Straight from my home in Rajasthan, India.  
This is the issue #37 and I hope you've read the issue #36. If you did, you'd probably remember the ending para where I disclosed my plan for this issue. And I don't intend to deviate from the plan.  

For a reminder, this issue will be about the independent apps fighting back when bigger bodies try to stop them.  
P.S. I don't
