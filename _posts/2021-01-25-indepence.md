Hey there,

Having fun there? Ofcourse you are, because why not!

I welcome you to another Knowledgeâ€¢Day issue. Straight from my home in Rajasthan, India.  
This is the issue #37 and I hope you've read the issue #36. If you did, you'd probably remember the ending para where I disclosed my plan for this issue. And I don't intend to deviate from the plan.  

For a reminder, this issue will be about the independent apps fighting back when bigger bodies try to stop them.  
P.S. This newsletter aims to be opinion-free for any topic covered. I have no intention of judging anyone here and this does not shaer any opinion on anything.

# Which parlor again?
_Not Parlor, **Parler**._  
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler), Parler is an American alt-tech microblogging and social networking service. In a nut-shell it's a twitter alternative. Which seems to have attracted [far-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics) user base thanks to its free-speech and unbiased marketing.  

The app was founded by John Matze Jr. and Jared Thomson, in August 2018. _Parler_ here has no reference from the regular _Parlor_ that you visit for facial-upgrades. _Parler_ is actually a french word, meaning "to speak". Hence the focus on "free speech".  

# What happened to it in January 2021
This extends to **2020**, where Parler experieced **signficant surge in signups** after Twitter flagged some of the president's tweets as "potentially misleading" and "glorifying violence". In the heat of the moment, Parler published a "Declaration of Internet Independence", and began using the "#Twexit" hashtag (a portmanteau of "Twitter" and "Brexit").  
Naturally the trump supporters moved to Parler. And the things were going good until...   

January 2021, when Parler was among the social media services used to plan the storming of US Capitol.  

Twitter then permanently suspended Donald Trump's account due to his remarks about storming the Capitol. Immediately, parler experienced a wave of downloads and became the top downloded app on January 8.  

# Parler in crosshairs
Noticing the surge in Parler's downloads, Google pulled the app off the Play store. And soon apple followed.   

It doesn't end there, twilio cut the service to parler as well - this killed the 2FA (Two-factor authentication). Scylla Database provider cut their database service and finally Amazon announced cutting off their entire AWS cloud services to parler as well.   
Imagine shooting a zombie all over the body in panic.
