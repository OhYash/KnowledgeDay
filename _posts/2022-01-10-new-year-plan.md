Happy New Year 2022!! 
![we started over cuz the last one got weird]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/new_year_reason.jpg)  
New year, new you! Today, with this blog-letter issue I'm trying to help you make a change in yourself.  

Why?  
This is often overlooked - _"Same shit, different year"_ we say and let the _same shit_ define our days, weeks, months, and years. They become monotonous.

I don't know about you, but I don't want them that way. I want this to be our best year!  

And with that, let's fix it. I found a plan.  
 
This is from a podcast episode [A Letter to Myself for the New Year](https://foundersjournal.morningbrew.com/a-letter-to-myself-for-the-new-year/) by Alex Liberman, founder of Morning Brew. He talks about the five pillars to planning for his new year.
That's mainly the inspiration I'm taking as I type here. We change from the inside through habits, not goals.  

> "Habits are not a finish line to be crossed, they are a lifestyle to be lived" <br/>- James clear(author of Atomic Habits)

Alrighty, we're all different. I can't write what should be good for you. So what I want you to do is read the points I wrote for **myself** and formulate changes that you want to see within **yourself**. Just like I did by listening to Alex making points for himself.  

Here we go! The five pillars:

### Family & Relations:
Have fewer, but more meaningful conversations with family members. Even if they are less frequent as once a week or two.  

Relationships are an investment. It is super easy to be a passenger in a relationship, but that shorts the commitment they deserve. I need to improve upon the efforts I make towards friendships.  

-----
### Health:
**Physical health**: During the first lockdown, back in 2020, I did build up a habit of working out regularly. All that faded off as I moved hometown 1.5 years back. Since then, I've been very lenient, and have gained fat. This has to change and I have to stick to my alternate days' workout schedule. And move to a daily workout schedule starting the month of March.  

**Mental Health**: I'm thankful for the peace of mind that I have had for most of the past year. The aim moving forward is to try going more out of my comfort zone this year, without affecting my mental health much. I have to keep a fixed break schedule, making Wednesday evenings work-free and Sunday no-screen days.

-----
### Wealth:
I'm grateful to have been able to keep earning throughout the pandemic so far. Can't ignore how hopeless it could've gotten without any financial movement. Now, I have been playing a little too much inside comfort zone. It's time to go experimentation mode. I will try out some alternate income streams this year. Aim to start that in the second quarter.  
Remember: Bigger dreams also have to have desirable targets. You don't want to <strike>hustle</strike> struggle endlessly trying to climb the **endless ladder** of money growth.  

To Improve: I haven't been paying enough attention to my existing investments lately, also have been postponing the efforts to invest afresh. Get learning. Aim to start a course for fundamental analysis starting the first week of Feb.

-----
### Work:
Time management. It's high time I fix that. I have been carelessly postponing any action towards this. This has been affecting both my office work and personal projects.  
I have to stop using my phone too much until the office work is complete. The social-network hours need to be pushed strictly towards the evening.  

This year, being somewhat more focused on experimentations, I have to prioritize my projects better than before. There should be no week without any update to [TenorCards](https://tenor.cards/) until at least the end of March.  

-----
### Play:
Can't just be working and focusing huh? Play here is anything that relaxes my mind. This shouldn't have targets or goals that I have to achieve.  
But in general, what I can say is that I have not been "Playing" enough.  

From now, I'm making Wednesday evenings the chill days for me (unless it's a day I have to send Knowledge•Day on). I can...
- Play games, laptop or retro games on the Raspberry PI
- Watch a movie or show
- Talk to people I haven't talked to in a while.
^ This is the opposite of Sundays, where I plan to minimize screen usage.
